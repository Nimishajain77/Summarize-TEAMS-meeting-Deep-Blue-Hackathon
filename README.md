              Summarizing-TEAMS-Meetings

Due to surge in online meetings and work-from-home after the wave of covid 19 pandemic, Microsoft Teams provides a wide range of functionalities and is widely used in business for meetings. Reading summaries is much more time-efficient by conveying the essence of the meeting in a very concise form and are useful in planning future action.


              Most Challenging aspect of the problem
Summarizing meetings is not similar to summarizing news articles or broadcast news. The sentence boundaries are very hard to discern as the conversation contains many disfluencies. Also, the information density in meetings is lower than in news, which has highly condensed information. As news articles have titles and lead text, taking the few initial lines of the news article yields a good summary, whereas no such metadata is available in the case of a meeting.

              Reason for Choosing this problem
Since there is no conclusive solution out there, covering all other aspects of the problem description while summarizing the discussion is really important. We can delve deeply and produce an accurate result using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning technologies. By finding a solution to this issue, we can automate summary and eliminate the necessity for individual note-taking.
